# SadIceCream_FunnyFaceFilter
A funny self-sarcastic face filter written in p5.js

This is a quick web-based face filter prototype written in p5.js. It features a sad melting ice cream that obssessively talks to itself in a state of existential crisis.
You can play with it [here](https://snowxu17.github.io/SadIceCream_FunnyFaceFilter/).

Note: Please make sure there is ample lighting for camera to see human faces : ). Also you may wanna wear headphones to avoid annoy people sitting next to you.
